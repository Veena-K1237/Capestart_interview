# Redesign of RedBus Ticket page:
1. As of now, on clicking of VIEW SEATS, will perform content layout shift and insert the bus seat view
2. I've redesigned to modal popup view, with tab approach. Thereby reducing Content Layout Shift
3. Accessibility is also met on open of popup as the focus will be moved and trapped within the same bus and will not confuse the screenreader users
